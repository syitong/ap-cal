\begin{onlyenv}<1>

\begin{itemize}
\item Integration of velocity is displacement;
\item Integration of acceleration is the variation of velocity;
\item Integration of speed is distance.\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
If a body moves along a straight line with velocity $v=t^{3}-3t^{2}$,
find the distance traveled between $t=1$ and $t=4$.
\end{example}

\end{onlyenv}



\begin{onlyenv}<2>

\begin{example}
A praticle $P$ moves along a curve so that its acceleration is given
by
\[
\mathbf{a}=\left(-4\cos2t,-2\sin t\right)\,,-\frac{\pi}{2}\le t\le\frac{\pi}{2}\,;
\]
when $t=0$, the particle is at $\left(1,0\right)$ with $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}=0$,
and $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}=2$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the position vector $\mathbf{R}$ at any time $t$.
\item Find a integral representing the distance $P$ travels from $t=0$
to $t=2$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\end{onlyenv}



\begin{onlyenv}<3>

\begin{example}
(net change) After $t$ minutes, a chemical is decomposing at the
rate of $10e^{-t}$ grams per minute. Find the amount that has decomposed
during the first $3$ minutes.
\end{example}



\begin{example}
Suppose a rumor is spreading at the rate of $f\left(t\right)=100e^{-0.2t}$
new people per day. Find the number of people who hear the rumor during
the $5$th and $6$th days.
\end{example}
